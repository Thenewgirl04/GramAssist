Campus Living & Housing
The Office of Campus Living & Housing recognizes the COVID-19 situation may present
                                 several challenges and concerns for our residents. Our plan is to provide a modified
                                 on-campus housing experience that provides residents with a sense of assurance that
                                 the proper safety precautions conducted will optimize the on-campus living experience
                                 in our new normal. There will be changes in use of the facilities, gathering of students
                                 for support and events, and select community expectations are all designed to manage
                                 social distancing and reduce exposure and transmission.
Although we have preventative measures in place to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and
                                 other illnesses, campus living and housing cannot guarantee that residents will not
                                 become exposed to COVID-19. Below you will find additional information regarding our
                                 COVID-19 policies as well as help tips.
Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at 318.274.2504 or at
