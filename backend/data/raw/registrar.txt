CLASS SCHEDULE ADJUSTMENTS
(Drops and Adds) ~ Students should select courses carefully and check their printout
                                    of courses immediately. Once a student’s registration has been validated (paid fees),
                                    the student can continue to make adjustments to his/her schedule of classes up to
                                    the last day of registration.

After registration ends, students should go to their advisors to get a drop/add form
                                    to make class adjustments. An approved form must be submitted to the Registrar’s Office
                                    before the change is official. The student will be given a copy of the form and should
                                    maintain it for his/her records. Classes cannot be added after the end of registration.
All students with vehicles must purchase an auto decal from the University Police
                                    Station.
Obtain mailbox and key in the Favrot Student Union. The fee is $15.00 [Fall and Spring
                                    Semesters]. To replace a lost key a fee of $10.00 will be assessed.
Purchase books and supplies at the University Bookstore, Favrot Student Union.
ANY student who has a registered fee sheet should be listed on the class roster. No
                                    student will be allowed to remain in class if his/her name is not on the permanent
                                    roster.
If you enroll in a course and never attend class, you will receive a failing grade
                                    unless you officially withdraw from the course on or before the deadline for course
                                    withdrawals. DO NOT ASSUME YOU WILL BE DROPPED FROM A COURSE IF YOU DO NOT ATTEND.
                                    As a safeguard, you should always drop any unwanted courses immediately.
Classes will be cancelled in the system for students who have not paid fees. A new
                                       class schedule from AVAILABLE classes must be entered for late registration.
